      title: "Full Stack Software Engineer",
      company: "Oberlin College", 
      period: "Jan 2025 - Current", 
      description: "I designed and implemented an end-to-end data pipeline for pitching performance, automating data ingestion from the cloud with daily cron jobs to ensure timely updates. I integrated FastAPI with Rapsodo‚Äôs REST API using secure API keys to fetch and persist pitch data into MongoDB, and built backend services that allow users to query and analyze performance on-demand. To support real-time analytics, I developed Python scripts that process and classify pitch data, generating interactive visualizations that contributed to a 6.8% improvement in team pitching success. On the frontend, I built a React dashboard with interactive charts and filters to make performance insights accessible and actionable. I also containerized the system with Docker and deployed it on AWS, enabling scalable, cloud-based access for the team."

      description: "Built and optimized a computational protein design pipeline using ML models such as RFDiffusionAA, LigandMPNN, Rosetta Libraries, and AlphaFold3, improving computational confidence metrics by roughly 4% per iteration. I automated large-scale protein design workflows with SLURM and Bash scripts on an HPC cluster, processing thousands of structures and sequences while reducing runtime by approximately 10%. I applied PyTorch-based ML techniques and statistical analyses to evaluate and improve binder affinity by up to 1000%, leveraging HPC resources to scale iterative design loops and enhance reproducibility and throughput. I also presented a research poster at the Summer Rosetta Conference, showcasing advancements in ML-driven protein design."

      description: "I worked in SplashBI's HR analytics team developing and maintaining automated data pipelines that transformed HR data from Oracle Cloud and MySQL into analytics-ready formats. I designed and optimized SQL database schemas to track key HR metrics like retention, turnover, and performance, and developed RESTful APIs to connect backend data with internal dashboards. By automating queries and Excel workflows, I reduced manual reporting time for enterprise clients by nearly 50%. I also created scalable data models to uncover growth opportunities and presented improvements in biweekly demos to stakeholders from multiple enterprise companies."

                <p>
                  I started my coding journey in college, fascinated by how lines of code 
                  could create beautiful, interactive experiences. What began as curiosity 
                  quickly became a passion.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, I specialize in building modern web applications using React, 
                  Next.js, and TypeScript. I love the challenge of turning complex problems 
                  into simple, elegant solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, 
                  contributing to open source projects, or sharing knowledge with 
                  the developer community.
